# Scraping Mercadolibre

## how does it work?

This is a process of data extraction from the MercadoLibre website, with the aim of identifying the most popular product based on a given search. The search is performed using a list of specific parameters. In other words, MercadoLibre is being explored to find the most searched or sold product, using search criteria.
